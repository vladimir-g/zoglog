 ZOGLOG - simple IRC logger with web interface
===============================================

This is a simple IRC logger with web interface implemented in Common
Lisp that can log multiple channels on different servers. Web
interface served via Hunchentoot_, logs stored in PostgreSQL using
Postmodern_ library.

ZOGLOG was tested on SBCL and Clozure CL, but may work on other Lisp
implementations.

About
=====

ZOGLOG was made just for fun, it's code isn't very good and not fully
tested, use it on your own risk (or don't use at all). 

Name comes from popular conspirancy theories (and jokes) about
all-seeing ZOG, don't take it seriously. Author doesn't think that
real ZOG exists *but that is his problem*.
